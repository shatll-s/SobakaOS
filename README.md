# Sobaka OS

Hello everyone!
**SobakaOS** is GPU mining platform.
At first I must say - it is very simple OS, there aren`t so many features like in cool systems like smos, hive, etc. Maybe something is not working properly because I tested it only on my and friendly rigs (mostly 470/480/570/580, 1060/1070/1080/1080ti, no VEGA or RTX).

Initial setup is simple - register on (https://sobaka.group), download the image, unpack, write it on ssd (I like Etcher), write in the settings file rig number and password, optional wifi ssid/password. After that, stick the SSD into the rig and everything should start.
Further management is made through the site.

#### Telegram notifications


There are notifications in Telegram, you should send the command /start 12345678 to the bot (change 12345678 to your code, visible on the user settings page or the farm settings page).
Rigs can be organized in a farm with collective access or simply delimit on some basis (f.e. my rigs are located in four places, so I have 4 farms). Everything seems to be intuitive clearly, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

The system is absolutely free. There are no hidden miners on the cpu, etc. Try & check.
