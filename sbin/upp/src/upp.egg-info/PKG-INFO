Description: ## UPP
        
        UPP: Uplift Power Play
        
        A tool for parsing, dumping and modifying data in Radeon PowerPlay tables
        
        ### Introduction
        
        UPP is able to parse and modify binary data structures of PowerPlay tables
        commonly found on certain AMD Radeon GPUs. Drivers on recent AMD GPUs
        allow PowerPlay tables to be dynamically modified on runtime, which may be
        known as "soft" PowerPlay table. On Linux, the PowerPlay table is by default
        found at: `/sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp_table`.
        
        ### Requirements
        
        Python 2.7 or 3.6+, click library. Optionally, for reading "soft" PowerPlay
        table from Windows registry: python-registry. Should work on Windows as well
        (testers wanted).
        
        ### Usage
        
        At its current form this is a CLI only tool. Getting help:

              UPP is able to parse and modify binary data structures of PowerPlay tables
              commonly found on certain AMD Radeon GPUs. Drivers on recent AMD GPUs
              allow PowerPlay tables to be dynamically modified on runtime, which may be
              known as "soft PowerPlay tables". On Linux, the PowerPlay table is by
              default found at:
        
                 /sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp_table
        
              There are also two alternative ways of getting PowerPlay data that this
              tool supports:
        
               - By extracting PowerPlay table from Video ROM image (see extract command)
               - Import "Soft PowerPlay" table from Windows registry, directly from
                 offline Windows/System32/config/SYSTEM file on disk, so it would work
                 from Linux distro that has acces to mounted Windows partition
                 (path to SYSTEM registry file is specified with --from-registry option)
        
              This tool currently supports parsing and modifying PowerPlay tables found
              on the following AMD GPU families:
        
                - Polaris
                - Vega
                - Radeon VII
                - Navi 10
                - Navi 14
        
              Note: iGPUs found in many recent AMD APUs are using completely different
              PowerPlay control methods, this tool does not support them.

            Options:
              -p, --pp-file <filename>        Input/output PP table binary file.
              -f, --from-registry <filename>  Import PP_PhmSoftPowerPlayTable from Windows
                                              registry (overrides -p / --pp-file option).
              -d, --debug / --no-debug        Debug mode.
              -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
        
            Commands:
              dump     Dumps all PowerPlay parameters to console.
              extract  Extract PowerPlay table from Video BIOS ROM image.
              get      Get current value of a PowerPlay parameter(s).
              set      Set value to PowerPlay parameter(s).
        
        Dumping all data:
        
            Usage: upp dump [OPTIONS]
        
              Dump all PowerPlay data to console
        
              De-serializes PowerPlay binary data into a human-readable text output. For
              example:
        
                  upp --pp-file=radeon.pp_table dump
        
              In standard mode all data will be dumped to console, where data tree
              hierarchy is indicated by indentation.
        
              In raw mode a table showing all hex and binary data, as well as variable
              names and values, will be dumped.
        
            Options:
              -r, --raw / --no-raw  Show raw binary data.
              -h, --help            Show this message and exit.
        
        Extracting PowerPlay table from Video ROM image:
        
            Usage: upp extract [OPTIONS]
        
              Extracts PowerPlay data from full VBIOS ROM image
        
              The source video ROM binary must be specified with -r/--video-rom
              parameter, and extracted PowerPlay table will be saved into file specified
              with -p/--pp-file. For example:
        
                  upp --pp-file=extracted.pp_table extract -r VIDEO.rom
        
              Default output file name will be an original ROM file name with an
              additional .pp_table extension.
        
            Options:
              -r, --video-rom <filename>  Input Video ROM binary image file  [required].
              -h, --help                  Show this message and exit.
        
        Getting parameter:
        
            Usage: upp get [OPTIONS] VARIABLE_PATH_SET...
        
              Retrieves current value of one or multiple PP parameters
        
              The parameter variable path must be specified in "/<param> notation", for
              example:
        
                  upp get /FanTable/TargetTemperature /VddgfxLookupTable/7/Vdd
        
              The raw value of the parameter will be retrieved, decoded and displayed on
              console. Multiple PP parameters can be specified at the same time.
        
            Options:
              -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
        
        Setting parameters:
        
            Usage: upp set [OPTIONS] VARIABLE_PATH_SET...
        
              Sets value to one or multiple PP parameters
        
              The parameter path and value must be specified in "/<param>=<value>
              notation", for example:
        
                  upp set /PowerTuneTable/TDP=75 /SclkDependencyTable/7/Sclk=107000
        
              Multiple PP parameters can be set at the same time. The PP tables will not
              be changed unless additional --write option is set.
        
              Optionally, if --to-reg output is used an additional Windows registry
              format file will be generated, named same as PowerPlay output target
              filename with an additional '.reg' extension.
        
            Options:
              -t, --to-reg  Save output to Windows registry .reg file as well.
              -w, --write   Write changes to PP binary.
              -h, --help    Show this message and exit.
